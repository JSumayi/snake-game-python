# Snake Game with Score, Obstacles, and Levels

This project entails the implementation of a traditional Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library, bolstered by features such as score tracking, randomly generated obstacles and varied difficulty levels. It stands as an instructive demonstration of integrating basic game mechanics and concepts related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Features

- **Score Tracking**: Each time the snake eats food, the score increments, displayed in the console.
- **Obstacles**: Randomly generated obstacles appear on the screen that the snake must navigate around. Red squares represent obstacles.
- **Levels and Speed Adjustment**: The game progresses through multiple levels with increasing speed. Higher levels challenge the player with faster snake movement.

**How to Play**

**Objective:** Eat food (green squares) to grow longer and increase your score.</br>
**Levels:** Progress through levels as your score increases, with faster snake movement at higher levels.</br>
Avoid Collisions with obstacles (red squares) and the snake's own body.

Use the arrow keys to control the snake:
- **Up:** Arrow Up
- **Down:** Arrow Down
- **Left:** Arrow Left
- **Right:** Arrow Right
